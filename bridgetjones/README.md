# bridgetjones

A visualization of the weights and the emotions expressed by Bridget Jones in her [diary][bj].She weighs herself nearly every day for a year; I have subsampled these for approximately weekly period. 

## code 
The bridget_jsoner.py file takes a text file containing bridget jones, generates a JSON of days on which weight was measured, corresponding dates, the weights and summary. A sample (book_1_gist.json) is provided. 127 days were collected. 


## status

- subsampled by week and performed visualizations in ggplot2 (codes.R)
